# Final3 Haptic Control Robot (ROS + Gazebo + STM32)

### 🎯 Overview
This project simulates and controls a **reaction-free haptic robotic arm** using **ROS, Gazebo, and STM32** hardware integration.  
The system features pitch-roll joints actuated via torque feedback, enabling human-interactive control with realistic physics.

### 🛠️ Current Progress
- ✅ URDF model created from SolidWorks with accurate link inertias and transmissions  
- ✅ Gazebo simulation stable with roll and pitch torque control  
- ⚙️ Ongoing: integrating STM32 for real-time haptic feedback  
- 📈 Next: implement bilateral control and advanced PID tuning
